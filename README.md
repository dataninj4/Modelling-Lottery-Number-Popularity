# Modelling Lottery Number Popularity

January 2020
 
The focus of interest however in this analysis are going to be two questions I am interested in answering:

1. <strong>Which numbers are how popular among the mean lottery participant to be picked on their tickets?</strong> This is of interest because number popularity is inverse with profit share quota in all but the lowest winning tier.
  
2. <strong>Follow up question: In case that someone has a winning game, one really might want to be able to predict the profit share quota, being directly dependant on the popularities of the numbers being drawn.</strong> The prediction error needs to be low in order to have any use.
